### <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span>

MoxiWorks Platform <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> entities represent buyer-side transactions that agents are working on.

###### <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> Stages

By default, each <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> passes through five stages. Each stage represents a different stage in the transaction lifecycle. Every <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> response will include the current stage of the <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> both in its numeric form as well as a human readable string representation.  As the transaction progresses through its lifecycle, you can promote it to the next stage.    See <a href='#promoting-sellertransaction-stage'>Promoting <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> Stage</a> for information about promoting a <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> object to the next stage.

Each <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> created through the MoxiWorks Platform will be created as a stage 3 (`active`) <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span>.

Use the table below to determine the mapping between the integer represented in <span class='attribute-name'>stage</span> and its human readable counterpart.</span>


stage | stage_name | description |
-----|-----|-----|-----|
0 | inactive | This is a discontinued <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span>. It cannot be edited, or moved to a different stage. |
1 | initialized | This is an empty <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> already associated with a <span class='entity-name'>Contact</span> and is ready to be configured  |
2 | configured | This is an inactive <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> that has been configured. This <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> is not actively being worked on. |
3 | active | This is a configured and active <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span>. The agent is actively working on this transaction. Once active, a transaction cannot be regressed to an earlier stage.
4 | pending | This is an active <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> that is in a `pending` state. |
5 | complete | This is a <span class='entity-name'>BuyerTransaction</span> which has been completed. |
