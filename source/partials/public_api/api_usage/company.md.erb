### <span class='entity-name'>Company</span>

MoxiWorks Plaform <span class='entity-name'>Company</span> entities are your entry-point for determining the established relationships for your organization to companies on the MoxiWorks Platform and for accessing data about those companies. Many requests require a <span class='attribute-name'>moxi_works_company_id</span>, which you'll need to derive from the <span class='entity-name'>Company</span> <span class='action-name'>Index</span> endpoint.
