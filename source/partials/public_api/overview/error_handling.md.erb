The following table specifies the recommended action for each MoxiWorks API error code.

<aside class='notice'>When reporting issues that are not resolvable using the following table, please include the entire response (including request_id) in your report.</aside>

> <strong>Use this table to implement error handling logic according to the following guidelines:</strong> <br><br> &bull; If the error code indicates a permanent error condition, do not retry the request. <br><br> &bull; If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, do not retry the request until the problem has been fixed.<br><br> &bull; If the error code indicates a problem that could be overcome by retrying the request after a period of time, retry the request using exponential backoff.
