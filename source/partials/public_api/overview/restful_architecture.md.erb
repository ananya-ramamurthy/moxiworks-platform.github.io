### RESTful Architecture

The response payload is JSON encoded object(s) with defined structure which reflects a data model.

URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions. For example, to get a list of contacts, use `GET https://api.moxiworks.com/contacts`.
This will return a list of Contact objects, where each Contact will have an "id" attribute.
To get details on a particular contact, use `GET https://api.moxiworks.com/contacts/123456`, where 123456 is the "id" of the Contact you want.
Similarly, to create a Contact, `POST` a Contact object to `https://api.moxiworks.com/contacts/`.
