```

```ruby

require 'moxiworks_platform'

platform_identifier = 'abc123' # platorm_identifier provided by MoxiWorks Platform Rep
platform_secret = 'secret' #platform_secret provided by MoxiWorks Platform Rep

MoxiworksPlatform::Credentials.new(platform_identifier, platform_secret)

```

```php

<?php
$platform_identifier = 'abc123'; // platorm_identifier provided by MoxiWorks Platform Rep

  <aside class="warning">To ensure that your key and secret remain secret, always use HTTPS when making requests from the MoxiWorks Platform public API.</aside>

The MoxiWorks API utilizes Authorization HTTP headers for authorization.

To authorize your request, use the API Identifier and Secret combination you have been provided by your MoxiWorks Platform representative.

When composing your basic header, per <a href='https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt'>RFC 2617</a> you'll need to base 64 encode your MoxiWorks Platform Identifier and Secret and remember to separate your platform identifier and secret with a colon.

<aside class='info'>Use your Partner ID as the Authorization header username and Partner Secret as the password.</aside>
