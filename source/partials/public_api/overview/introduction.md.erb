### Introduction

> **Production Base URL**:  https://api.moxiworks.com/

> **QA Base URL**:  https://api-qa.moxiworks.com/

The MoxiWorks API provides programmatic access to MoxiWorks features and data. 
We do our best to adhere to open and accepted common standards, including REST for access, JSON format for the data, and HTTP Basic Auth for Authorization. 

The URL for the production version of the MoxiWorks API is referenced in the API Usage section of the documentation. When developing your integration into the MoxiWorks Platform using QA credentials, you can replace the production URL with the QA URL. The hostname for the QA environment is https://api-qa.moxiworks.com instead of api.moxiworks.com. In any production URL referenced in the documentation, simply subsitute the QA hostname for the production hostname.
