### OAuth Authentication

MoxiWorks provides an authentication service to allow clients to use MoxiWorks user accounts on their own properties.
This can be useful to avoid managing end-user accounts and to provide a more seamless integration between MoxiWorks sites and client sites.

Authentication is provided with the industry-standard [OAuth 2 protocol](http://oauth.net/2/).
OAuth 2 is used to get an access token for an individual user.
That access token can then be used to look up information about the user, including a user's unique identifier.
